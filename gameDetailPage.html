                    <p>Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment and
                        published by Electronic Arts. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and
                        Xbox
                        One on February 4, 2019, without any prior announcement or marketing.
                        The gameplay of Apex fuses elements from a variety of video games, including Respawn's
                        own
                        Titanfall series, battle royale games, class-based shooters, and those with evolving
                        narratives. Approximately sixty players are pitted against each other on an island in
                        squads
                        of three, with one player controlling where their squad lands. The squads then must
                        scavenge
                        for weapons and other resources to fight other squads, during which the play area
                        gradually
                        constricts in size until one squad remains, thus ending the match. The game also
                        features
                        care packages and the ability to revive your teammates within a certain amount of time.
                        Communication with team members can be done through voice chat or through a ping system,
                        allowing teammates to mark supplies, locations, and enemies with ease. The game features
                        eight heroes to choose from (though two of them are locked by default), and features a
                        microtransaction system for cosmetic items.
                        The concept for the game came to fruition during the development of a new Titanfall
                        game,
                        after EA's acquisition of Respawn in 2017. The sudden success of the battle royale genre
                        prompted the developers to create one of their own that incorporates elements of the
                        series,
                        in addition to the concepts seen in games throughout the past decade. Following its
                        release,
                        the developers announced plans for cross-platform play, as well as ports for iOS,
                        Android,
                        and the Nintendo Switch, in the future.
                        Apex Legends received very positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay,
                        progression system, and fusion of elements from various genres. Some considered it a
                        worthy
                        competitor to Fortnite Battle Royale, a similar game that had gained massive popularity
                        in
                        the previous year. The game surpassed over 25 million players by the end of its first
                        week,
                        and 50 million within its first month. </p>

                    <p>Devil May Cry 5 is an upcoming action-adventure hack and slash video game developed and
                        published by Capcom. It is the fifth installment of the mainline Devil May Cry series, and is
                        scheduled to be released on 8 March 2019. Devil May Cry 5 received a positive reception from
                        critics. The gameplay will feature the return of Dante and Nero as playable characters, along
                        with a new character, named "V". The gameplay is similar to the other titles in the Devil
                        May Cry series, focusing on fast-paced "stylish action". The player fights off hordes of demons
                        with a variety of attacks and weapons and receives a style-rating in combat based on a number of
                        factors, such as move variety, the length of a combo and dodging attacks. The music in the game
                        will change based on the player's performance in combat.
                        Nero is equipped with his Red Queen sword, his Blue Rose double-barreled revolver, and an
                        assortment of new robotic arms called Devil Breakers, with a variety of functions such as
                        grabbing enemies from a distance or stopping time to freeze an enemy in place. Along with his
                        signature blade Rebellion and the demonic sword Sparda, Dante was shown using two new Devil
                        Arms, a pair of buzzsaw-like weapons that combine into a motorcycle called Cavaliere, and a set
                        of fiery gauntlets and boots called Balrog. In addition, Dante will also wield Cerberus,
                        introduced in Devil May Cry 3. The third playable character, V, is shown wielding a cane and
                        a book. During an interview, Capcom decided not to disclose how exactly V fights yet, though
                        have teased that V's combat would be completely different from Nero's and Dante's. In the
                        Game Awards 2018 trailer, it is revealed that V uses three demons based on enemies from the
                        first game to fight which includes Griffon, an eagle that uses ranged lightning based attacks,
                        Shadow, a panther that forms blades, spikes and portals out of its body, and Nightmare, a large
                        golem which V enters a Devil Trigger-like state, which turns his hair white, to summon, which
                        uses a combination of melee attacks and laser beams.</p>

                    <p>Monster Hunter: World is an action role-playing game developed and published by Capcom. A part
                        of the Monster Hunter series, it was released worldwide for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in
                        January 2018, with a Microsoft Windows version in August 2018. In the game, the player takes the
                        role of a Hunter, tasked to hunt down and either kill or trap monsters that roam in one of
                        several environmental spaces. If successful, the player is rewarded through loot consisting of
                        parts from the monster and other elements that are used to craft weapons and armor, amongst
                        other equipment. The game's core loop has the player crafting appropriate gear to be able to
                        hunt down more difficult monsters, which in turn provide parts that lead to more powerful gear.
                        Players may hunt alone, or can hunt in cooperative groups of up to four players via the game's
                        online services.
                        Announced at E3 2017, Monster Hunter: World adopts the series' standard formulas from its older
                        home console roots and recent handheld games to take advantage of the higher processing power
                        provided by modern consoles and computers. Changes made in Monster Hunter: World include
                        creating environmental spaces that are fully connected and removing the "zones" that were
                        necessary for the PlayStation 2 and handheld games, more advanced monster artificial
                        intelligence and physics to create seemingly living ecosystems that could be taken advantage of
                        during hunts, a more persistent cooperative multiplayer experience, and a refinement of the
                        game's user interface, menu systems, and tutorials to help with bringing new players into the
                        series. These changes led Capcom to plan for the game's simultaneous release across both Japan
                        and Western markets, since Monster Hunter as a series has generally languished in the West
                        compared to Japan partially due to disparate release schedules. Capcom also opted to support
                        online play between these different geographic regions for similar reasons. The delay for the
                        Windows release was attributed to Capcom seeking to make sure its first foray into the Windows
                        market was optimized for players on computers.
                        Monster Hunter: World received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising how Capcom
                        was able to make the game more accessible to new players and to Western markets, without
                        detracting from the series' core gameplay elements and enjoyable difficulty, and fully taking
                        advantage of the computational capacity of modern consoles to create living ecosystems, and some
                        even calling it the best in the franchise. Monster Hunter: World is the best-selling game in
                        Capcom's history, with nearly 12 million copies shipped by the end of 2018. </p>
